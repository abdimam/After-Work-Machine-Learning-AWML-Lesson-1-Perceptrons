# After-Work-Machine-Learning-AWML-Lesson-1-Perceptrons
Welcome to AWML! I'm currently on winter holidays from work, and I decided to use this time to refresh my machine learning skills. After spending so much time in the lab, it's easy to lose touch with programming, so I thought it would be a great opportunity to revisit some foundational ML concepts.

This repository marks my first session in this process, and I decided to start with an introduction to Perceptrons, a simple yet powerful neural network model. The project focuses on using a perceptron to classify genes based on GC content and sequence length, two important features in genomics. While this is generally not the best method for classifying genes, it's a fun way to combine my passion for biology with machine learning.

I've also included a plot that visualizes the decision boundary of the perceptron. If you're unfamiliar with this concept, feel free to check out [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron#Learning_algorithm_for_a_single-layer_perceptron) for a deeper dive into how it works. 

Feel free to explore the code, and stay tuned for more updates as I continue to dive deeper into the world of machine learning!

# Usage
Simply run the script, and it will fetch gene data from NCBI and train the perceptron. The NCBI API client was mostly reused from a previous project of mine (CHECK IT OUT). You can modify the hyperparameters and the NCBI query to suit your needs.

# Why?
Why did I choose to approach it this way? Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but it was fun, and that's what matters the most. ðŸ˜Š
